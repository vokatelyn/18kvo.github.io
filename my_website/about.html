    <p>What's up everyone!! As you can see, I'm Katelyn and this year I'm a junior. Computer science to me is extremely interesting and is something I would love to do in the future. I aspire to inspire others and feel comfortable doing so in my sport. I also enjoy eating snacks and small meals throughout the day instead of comsuming the basic three meal courses. Not to mention, I never skip breakfast. All in all, I don't bite and I would love to meet new people!! HMU <3</p>
