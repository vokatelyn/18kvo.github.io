      My game Under the Sea includes two fish characters as it is a two player game. The score increases by one when a character touches a food item and decreases by one when the character touches the nonfood item. After a minute, which ever character has the highest score wins! There are slight complications with the scoring but the game is still playable when the character freezes after touching a nonfood item.

      Ms. Nguyen's activity for introduction of our game is this Wizard character which I have named Vinh after my old partner. It was quote fun, but complicated for a first experience. The Wizard will change its position depending on which direction it is facing. Also once the Wizard touches a fruit then the fruit will change and go to a different position in the map. The scripts of the fruit were complicated to start off with but after a while it was simple to control.

      The story my partner and I made replicated a rags to riches theme for the main character Tyrese begins the story as a trash lord. Tyrese has many opportunities to change himself and learn the responsibility of spending. The both of us had to know and understand the function of if-elif-else loops in order to create the story. There were major problems when creating the structure of the story since we wanted it to be original but funny to our peers. I particularly like this story since it represents my partner's and my own personality with the different choices and random details. Some of which include the Anime Expo or Mansion situation if you choose to go a certain way. If we were to improve on this story, then I'd like to introduce more characters.
