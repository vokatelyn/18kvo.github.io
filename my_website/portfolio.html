      My game Under the Sea includes two fish characters as it is a two player game.
      <br>
      The score increases by one when a character touches a food item and decreases 
      <br>
      by one when the character touches the nonfood item. After a minute, which ever
      <br>
      character has the highest score wins! There are slight complications with the 
      <br>
      scoring but the game is still playable when the character freezes after touching
      <br>
      a nonfood item.

      Ms. Nguyen's activity for introduction of our game is this Wizard character which 
      <br>
      I have named Vinh after my old partner. It was quote fun, but complicated for a first
      <br>
      experience. The Wizard will change its position depending on which direction it is 
      <br>
      facing. Also once the Wizard touches a fruit then the fruit will change and go to a 
      <br>
      different position in the map. The scripts of the fruit were complicated to start off
      <br>
      with but after a while it was simple to control.

      The story my partner and I made replicated a rags to riches theme for the main character
      <br>
      Tyrese begins the story as a trash lord. Tyrese has many opportunities to change himself 
      <br>
      and learn the responsibility of spending. The both of us had to know and understand the 
      <br>
      function of if-elif-else loops in order to create the story. There were major problems 
      <br>
      when creating the structure of the story since we wanted it to be original but funny to
      <br>
      our peers. I particularly like this story since it represents my partner's and my own 
      <br>
      personality with the different choices and random details. Some of which include the
      <br>
      Anime Expo or Mansion situation if you choose to go a certain way. If we were to improve
      <br>
      on this story, then I'd like to introduce more characters.
